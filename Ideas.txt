-collect 5 meddalions/gems/whatever to open boss door
-box puzzles
-combat puzzles?

Technical stuff:
-Levels are classes?
 -Rooms are classes as well (keep track of how many doors and on what side)
 -Each level has a list of the room class


Maybe cool ideas:
-some rooms are dark and require a torch or a light source
-find out how to do cool lighting effect

-recap at the end of level who did the most, damage, collected the most coins etc.

-3-4 player competitive mode þar sem 2 auka playerarnir geta stjórnað óvinum 
 og bosses og reyna að drepa player 1-2

-2D sidescroller segments. Boss sem getur flippað skjánum.
